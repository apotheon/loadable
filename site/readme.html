<h1>WEDGE README</h1>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The wedge gem provides an easy to use interface for adding custom load
managers to Ruby&#8217;s standard load system (the #load and #require
methods).

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>
Wedge was written initially to provide the single capability of loading
Ruby standard libraries without potential interference from installed gems.
The code naturally evolved into something more generic, useful for writing
any kind of add-on load manager. The code for the Ruby wedge serves as a
good example of writing a wedge.
</p>
<pre>
  require 'wedge/kernel'
  require 'rbconfig'

  Wedge.new :Ruby do

    # Notice that rubylibdir takes precedence.
    LOCATIONS = ::RbConfig::CONFIG.values_at(
      'rubylibdir', 'archdir', 'sitelibdir', 'sitearchdir'
    )

    #
    def call(fname, options={})
      return unless md = /^ruby[:\/]/.match(fname)

      file = md.post_match

      LOCATIONS.each do |loadpath|
        if path = find(loadpath, file, options)
          return super(path, options)
        end
      end

      raise LoadError, &quot;no such file to load -- #{fname}&quot;
    end

  end
</pre>
<p>
Wedge.new is actually just a helper method. One could write a load wedge
without it as the interface is very simple. Any object the responds to
#call taking parameters of <tt>(fname, options={})</tt> can be used as a
load wedge.  Simply register it via:
</p>
<pre>
  Wedge.register(mywedge)
</pre>
<p>
Wedge.new makes it a bit easier by automatically creating an object
extended by the Wedge::Helper module, which provides a few methods that can
be generally useful to any load manager, and then registers the object as a
load wedge automatically. As the example above shows, it also allows one to
name their wedge, which can be useful for debugging load issues.
</p>
<p>
You might wonder how the single method, #call, handles both #load and
#require operations. The secret is in the <tt>options</tt> hash. If
<tt>options[:load]</tt> resolves to true, then it is a <tt>load</tt>
operation, otherwise it is a <tt>require</tt> operation.
</p>
<p>
As wedges are registered, they are added to a list in order of
registration. When #load or #require is called each wedge is tried in turn.
The return value of #call controls how this loop proceeds. If the return
value is <tt>true</tt> then the load was successful, and the loop can
break. If it is <tt>false</tt> it means the loading has already been
handled and the loop can also break. But if the return value is
<tt>nil</tt>, it means the wedge does not apply and the loop should
continue. If all wedges have been tried and all have returned <tt>nil</tt>
then it falls back to the original #load and #require calls.
</p>
<h2>Provided Wedges</h2>
<p>
Wedge provides two wedges out-of-the-box, the Ruby wedge and the Gem wedge.
</p>
<h3>Ruby Wedge</h3>
<p>
The Ruby wedge is considered standard fare. When you require
&#8216;wedge&#8217; it will load the wedge kernel and also the Ruby wedge.
</p>
<p>
The Ruby wedge makes it possible to load a Ruby standard library without
interference from installed gems or other package systems.
</p>
<pre>
  require 'wedge'

  require 'ruby:ostruct'
</pre>
<p>
This will load the ostruct.rb script from the Ruby standard library
regardless of whether some newbie dropped an ostruct.rb file in their
projects lib/  directory without understand the consequences.
</p>
<h3>Gem Wedge</h3>
<p>
The Gem wedge is similar to the Ruby wedge, in that it isolates the loading
of a gem&#8217;s files from other gems.
</p>
<pre>
  require 'wedge/gem'

  gem 'facets', '~&gt;2.8'

  require 'facets:string/margin'
</pre>
<p>
With this we can be sure that &#8216;facets/string/margin&#8217; was loaded
from the facets library regardless of whether some other gem put a
&#8216;facets/string/margin&#8217; file in their lib/ directory.
</p>
<p>
To complement Wedge and it&#8217;s built-in Gem Wedge, you can install the
<tt>gem-wedge</tt> gem.
</p>
<pre>
  $ gem install gem-wedge
</pre>
<p>
This turn the Gem Wedge into a gem plug-in, so it will be automatically
loaded whenever RubyGems is loaded. See the the <tt>gem-wedge</tt> <a
href="http://github.com/rubyworks/gem-wedge">README</a> file for more
information about the Gem Wedge and why it is so useful.

title: Load
name: load
version: 1.1.0
description: ! "The Wedge gem provides an easy to use interface for adding custom\nload
  managers to Ruby's standard load system (the `load` and `require`\nmethods).\n\nIn
  addition, Wedge includes two pre-assembled wedges that prevent \nload interfence
  between libraries."
